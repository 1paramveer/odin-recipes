    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

      <li>1.5 lbs (700g) boneless chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Marinate the chicken: In a bowl, mix together the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger paste, garlic paste, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight in the refrigerator for better flavor.</li>
      <li>Cook the chicken: Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Cook the marinated chicken until it is cooked through and has a slightly charred appearance. Alternatively, you can bake the chicken in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 20-25 minutes or until cooked.</li>
      <li>Prepare the butter chicken sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat ghee or vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and cook until it turns golden brown.

        Add the ginger and garlic paste: Stir in the ginger paste and garlic paste and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add the spices: Add ground cumin to the pan and cook for a minute, stirring continuously to avoid burning.</li>
